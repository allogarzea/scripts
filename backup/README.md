# Backup
###### par garzea
This is a guide for basic backup scripts for Android and Linux devices.

## Which files will be backed up?
In general, these scripts will do a backup from ```/Documents```, ```/Pictures``` and ```/Recovery```. Mobile script also includes ```/DCIM``` folder.

### ```/Recovery``` folder
In this folder, I keep all my security/recovery keys, TOTP keys and Bitwarden's vault backup in encrypted files.
